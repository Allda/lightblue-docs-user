# Java Client

Source: https://github.com/lightblue-platform/lightblue-client

This library was started as a side project and has become a core part of the lightblue-platform.  It continues to evolve, but is in a state that it can be used.

## Add as Maven Dependency
Add the client library to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.redhat.lightblue.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>lightblue-client-http</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

NOTE: the artifactId changes with the upcoming 1.2.0 release.  For the most recent release use:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.redhat.lightblue.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>http</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
